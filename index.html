                            For summer 2020 (and currently still working) I began a new journey by working for a brand new start-up
                            tech company aimed at digitalizing the real-estate market. I wrote the entire user interface for this product from scratch
                            by myself in 4 months and we are currently serving a hundred or so real-estate contractors and realtors.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This was my third co-op and here I discovered my true potential as a software engineer. Often, I found
                            myself being pushed to my limits and accomplishing things I never thought were possible to do within 4
                            months by myself. I learned on an exponential scale and became a self-claimed master of React.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This application is built on React upon Node.js and uses Material-UI for pre-styled html elements. I do server calls
                            using axios and manage application state using redux. I do routing for the application through react-router
                            and have 3 routes for un-authenticated users, authenticated customers and authenticated contractors.

                        <li>
                            I worked on multiple SAP Big Data Tooling websites in Fall 2019 at SAP Waterloo. I mostly
                            created new front-end UI applications for the website however I also added extra depth to their
                            database history collection API as well as created a new algorithm and function for starting and
                            stopping databases remotely.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This was my second co-op and I learned quite a lot about how developing features that affect hundreds
                            of thousands of clients must invovle extensive testing and extreme attention to detail.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I coded the front-end user interface for these websites in XML and javascript using SAP Fiori design
                            elements, whislt I coded the back-end in Java.

                            as well as the latency for data streaming in Cloud applications.

                            I love coffee, so I decided to make a machine to help drink my coffee safely. The Smart Coffee Mug was developed using
                            an Arduino board programmed in C++ using Onewire libraries to control its components.
                        </li>

                            It consists of a Coffee Cup, a Servo Motor, Temperature Sensor, Touch Sensor and Speaker.

                        <li>
                            First and foremost the mug constantly samples and displays the temperature of the beverage in the mug. It opens the lid
                            of the cup whenever a user picks up the contraption. Furthermore, it keeps the lid open for the beverage inside the mug 
                            to cool if the beverage is too hot. Finally, it alerts users who pick up the contraption when it is too hot.
